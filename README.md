Repo for a Webpack course on Udemy

You can download this repository by using the green `Clone or Download` button on the right hand side of this page.  This will present you with the option to either clone the repository using Git, or to download it as a zip file.

The `js_modules` is a first part of the course where we learn basics of webpack.
The real example is on the `webpack-project`.
